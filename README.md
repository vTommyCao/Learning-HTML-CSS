# Web-Systems-Assignment
My first venture into website development and use of HTML/CSS. 

This assignment required the creation of a functional website with a set of requirements.
No template or sample/skeleton code was provided, and the majority of learning was done through experimenting and use of online resources. 
Written majorly within the Brackets IDE with directory and file permissions adjusted using Linux terminal. 




//Assignment requirements: 


The Web Assignment is a major component of assessment for the course.  It involves constructing a simple web page about yourself, using only low level tools, in a Unix environment. Here we will describe the different resources you will need and how to gain access to them.  The attached file (its contents are also given below for easy access) gives the Web Assignment Specification,  that is what you must do to complete the assignment, and well as more details on resources.

This description is new for Autumn 2020, due to the adoption of Ed for the first time, plus the move to fully on-line delivery due to COVID-19.  Some details are still being worked out. Watch this space!   

Unix Environment
You will need a Unix environment within which to develop your code.  Any of the following options will work:

you have access to a computer with a Unix-like operating system, such as MacOS or Linux  ( Ideal! )
you have a Windows OS, but within it can access a Unix OS or Unix-like features :
WSL  (Windows Subsystem for Unix)
Bash for Windows 10  (not a fully Unix system, just a Bash shell terminal program)
Linux as a Virtual Machine with the free VMplayer software
Linux with Virtual Box via Vagrant (also free)
using the Unix interface and features of  EdStem
Note that the last option, using Ed, although convenient in many ways, is not ideal as it is not a fully fledged Unix environment, and various limitations in using it are likely to arise.  You are advised to use one of the other alternatives if possible.

In creating your assignment files, you are expected to write html and css files manually using a text editor such as vim. More sophisticated editors that provide html syntax highlighting, indentation, and delimiter completion etc. are permitted, as long as they do not generate content.  Thus, purpose built webpage building Apps or environments such as DreamWeaver are NOT permitted.  More details on what is, and is not, allowed, is provided under the Web Assignment Specification below.

Webpage Rendering
You will need a way to view and test your draft Webpage code.   Normally this would require a web server where your content would be hosted. However this is not essential here as you will be writing your code in html which is static, unlike php which must be interpreted, and html can be viewed by any browser.   Thus it is possible for you to initially develop your page locally on your computer, using a browser to render your locally created and edited html files.  To finalise your webpage however, you will need to ensure that it will render correctly when externally hosted, thus in particular it must not contain any local links when complete. Of course if you have a hosting solution open to you, you are welcome to use it from the very beginning. 

Making your final Webpage public

Once your webpage is ready, for marking and viewing purposes, your webpage does require hosting by a publically accessible web server.  We intend to do this via a server hosted out of FEIT.  You will submit your final webpage files via Ed.  From Ed, they will then be copied to the FEIT server where they will be publically viewable.
