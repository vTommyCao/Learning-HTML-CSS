                <h1>Short-term/Faraway Goals And Other Fun Things</h1>
     <h3>Short-Term Aspirations</h3> 
            <p>My short term aspirations are primarily focused on 3 things:</p>
            
              <ul>
                <li>Finishing the remainer of my course with strong academic grades&#59;</li>
                
                <li>Building a habit to being productive with my down-time -- primarily by self studying and working on projects&#59;</li>
                
                <li>And finally, trying to find better work opportunuities to facilitate better accumulation of IT related experience. </li>
            </ul>
    
            <p>My objective in focusing on these things is to make the most out of the time available now to prepare myself to enter the IT workforce competitively -- which I am expecting to be difficult due to my lack of a focused major or more relevant</p>
            
    <h3>Long-Term Goals</h3>
            <p>My long term goals are not as laid out for me, but I am excited to navigate just look around and explore what I have fun with most -- one step at a time. </p>
                <p>Currently I am working as an on-site desktop support technician for schools, and although I am grateful for the opportunity, would like to move onto something that would provide new learning experiences with new technologies, possibly with more of a technical focus than the end-user/customer service skills that are required of me right now.</p>
        
            
    <h3>Desired Skills to Learn and Other Fun Ideas</h3>
                <p>Since learning of my enthusiasm for technology as a whole, I have been much more keen to explore what kind of skills I could pick up, in addition to fun little tech projects I could get my hands dirty with. </p>
            <p>Some skills I would like to pick up include&#58;</p>
        <ul>
           <li>Powershell for automation functions <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Windows-PowerShell-Month-Lunches/dp/1617291080" target="_blank"> &#40;Powershell in a month of lunches I'm looking at you!&#41;.</a>    
                </li>
            <li>Python for automation/scripting functions.</li>
            <li>Functional experience in managing AD environments.</li>
        </ul>                  
            <p>In addition to these, I would like to accumulate more knowledge in Networking and Firewall/OS theory -- hopefully to lean me into the space enough to get a taste of InfoSec!
            </p>
       
                <h3>Other Fun projects</h3>
            
            <p>Ambitious career things aside, there are many fun projects I would like to do, such as a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aa3VVZA0e5Y" target="_blank"> DIY Magic mirror,</a> setting up of a personal Plex server and the creation of a personally hosted File Server.
            </p>
