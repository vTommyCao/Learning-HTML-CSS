  <h1> Hey there! </h1>	
       	
   <p> Welcome to the interactive website that is my first venture into HTML and CSS coding. I've had plenty of fun learning and working on this project, so I hope you'll enjoy poking around.</p>
		
		
   <p> Fun Fact before you head in to explore -- I'm actually a business student! </p>
        
   <p> Aimlessly drifting into a "reliable" business course out of highschool, I found the idea of committing to 2 Business orientated majors <b>way too daunting</b> -- but luckily UTS provided IT as a major for the course <a href="https://handbook.uts.edu.au/courses/c10026.html" target="_blank"> (C10026 - Bachelor of business).</a></p>
        
   <p> Fast-forward 2 years to my penlultimate year and I've got a newfound interest and passion for the IT space that I can't wait to learn more about once graduating the rest of my <i>mainly business</i> subjects left! </p>
         
   <p>With that out of the way, click on to learn more about me!</p>
